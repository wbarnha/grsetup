# grsetup
A Bash script to simplify GNU Radio builds from source. Note that this uitilizes my fork of GNU Radio 3.8 for now since I really like the Filter Design Tool.

To utilize this, run the following commands in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/wbarnha/grsetup/
cd grsetup
./setup
```
This will ask you for permission to install the dependencies from your package manager. This installation will take thirty or so minutes.

Once the process is done, `reboot` your computer and GNU Radio 3.8 is set for you.
